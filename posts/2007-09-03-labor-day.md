Happy Labor Day. Should it be happy? I’m really not sure all work performed is done with love. I used to work in my Dad’s Deli years ago…that was hard work. I did not love it.  I’ll throw down a few hours of work just doing something. I’ll make sure I love it. It probably will not make me any money….yet.
