It was very sad (for me at least) to see the last Shuttle mission take off today. The video of launch was [fantastic](http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/07/08/space.shuttle/index.html?hpt=hp_c1). Will the dream continue? If we don’t I’m fearful we are losing our edge and our ability to create. The right stuff that made us great in the first place. So today I don’t feel so great.
