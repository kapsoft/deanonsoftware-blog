I’m finding node.js very interesting. Doing some client side JQuery lately brought it to my attention. Also I’ve been looking at various ways to do Web Application level stuff these days. [Now it’s coming to Windows](http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2011/06/nodejs-coming-to-windows-azure-with-official-microsoft-support.ars?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+arstechnica%2Findex+%28Ars+Technica+-+Featured+Content%29). Performance for node.js is [staggeringly](http://zgadzaj.com/benchmarking-nodejs-basic-performance-tests-against-apache-php) good, compared to PHP or .NET.  The worry is the event model and the onslaught of spaghetti code.  Debugging JavaScript is a little tedious to be honest. The problem is I don’t like many of the solutions just yet, but will need to settle on one.
