We have a great fascination with clocks. As unvealed by [Stephen Hawkings](http://www.engadget.com/2008/09/21/stephen-hawking-unveils-the-most-morbid-amazing-1-8m-clock-you/) , I’m not sure what to make of this thing. But everything in my business is driven by time. The programs are based on time. How you get paid is based on time. And it is human nature to under estimate time; I see this everyday. So this [Corpus Clock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_Clock) is just another way to honor time. 

The [Antikythera mechanism ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism)remained a mystery for years after its discovery. But it turned out to be a very sophisticated clock. Another way to honor time with something way ahead of its own time.  

So grasp every grain of sand you can catch. The time is short.
