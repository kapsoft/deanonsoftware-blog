Marc Andreessen  is a very very smart guy. Not only that he is a fantastic writer. I caught his recent blog about [career planning](http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/10/the-pmarca-guid.html). I’ll post it here for my son Jake to read. Hopefully he will. One thing did strike me he said at the end of the piece. “_You’re going to screw up — frequently_ ….._It can’t faze you — you have to be able to just get right back up and keep on going.”_
