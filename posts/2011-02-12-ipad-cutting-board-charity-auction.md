I put one iPad Cutting Board up for a auction with the proceeds going to charity. So far so good as highest bid over the $200 mark. And plenty of time to go. It is listed on the home page of this blog.

I had to figure out how to put an auction on my wordpress site. I found this [Auction plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-auctions/) and in ten minutes if was up on the site. Wish all tech went this easy.
