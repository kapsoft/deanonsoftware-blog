Well Autotestcon 2007 is over and I must say being my first one I was impressed. Very nice people these Mil-Aero folks. My talk went well – albeit it was pretty early (8am). I can’t say the other SI talks were that impressive except for Wade Loudermilk’s. They seem to have the DSP end if SI going well at BAE.

Last night they rented out the National Aquarium (Baltimore) for their gala.  Pretty nice event with Dolphin show and fireworks. My thanks to John W. Sheppard, PhD at  Johns Hopkins University for organizing all the talks and putting up with us.
