This clip is down temporarily due to high volume. It’s called [Reverie](http://blog.vincentlaforet.com/2008/09/22/without-further-ado-reverie/) by [Vincent LaForet](http://www.laforetvisuals.com/main.php) – a Pulitzer prize winning photographer. When it gets re hosted please do give it a look. A Mac would be the best place to view with Quicktime. Also, check out his portfolio. Good stuff. No great stuff.

The key point he did this all as he says with a “prototype EOS 5D MKII that Canon allowed me to borrow over a 72 hour”. A still camera. Digital SLR. Kind of a game changer when a 3k prosumer camera can do HD Vid that until a few days ago would be a 100k entry fee. Cool.
