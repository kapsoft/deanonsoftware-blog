I changed the look of both DeanOnSoftware.com (this blog) and our company site Kapsoft.com.  The [Kapsoft.com](http://kapsoft.com/) is the refresh of our old site – and please note it is still under construction. I’m going to work on the content. For DeanOnSoftware I went to the Thesis theme with a simple look with just my picture at the top. Keep in mind this is the only good pic I’ve ever taken and I don’t look half as handsome.

Kapsoft.com was changed to reflect my diverse technology interests. I know this is a world of specialists (and I do have one specialty in Test and Measurement), but my interests in other areas keep me interested in my business. For instance:

  * Test and Measurement using Microsoft C# .NET tools
  * Synthetic Instruments – also using .NET
  * iPad and iPhone Stencils
  * iPad and iPhone SketchBooks (now published by Apress)
  * Member of “Works with iPhone” Accessory” program. – working on development platform based on Stellaris ARM Cortex M3.
  * Embedded Design – various consulting projects.
