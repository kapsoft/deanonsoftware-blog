Interesting post by [Seth Godin about what happens when times are slow](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/07/winning-on-the-uphills.html). Or what you should be doing. Nothing is gained going downhill on your bike or when times are good. The best things are acheived when things are slow.

So I reflected on my own situation. What am I doing? I have 3 product ideas at some stage of “not complete” and one ready to launch. I love to see things get completed. Some of them might not, but I’m learning so much as I go along. New things excite and keep one going. I’ll talk about the one “thing” that’s coming out in the next coming days.

Climb your Alps. Start today.
