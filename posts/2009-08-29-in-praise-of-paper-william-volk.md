[“In Praise of Paper”](http://iphonegames.typepad.com/extremepreneur/2009/08/by-request-in-praise-of-paper.html) by William Volk. Thanks to William for re-introducing this fine piece from 1998 discussing UI design.  Thanks also for the plug of the [iPhone Application Sketch Book](http://www.mobilesketchbook.com/).

My favorite line from the essay:

> “Drawing is a fast and inexpensive way to look at several possibilities and to arrive at the ever important design consensus.”

Well said from a good read that has stood the test of time. Thanks for bringing it back for us.
