I was going to post another thought today, but got pleasant news that my son [Jake Kaplan](http://www.collegian.psu.edu/staff/jake_kaplan.aspx) won award from the best feature article for 2011 from the [PA Keystone Press](http://www.pa-newspaper.org/) awards contest.

[“Musser beats the odds](http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2010/04/22/musser_beats_the_odds.aspx)” is the article. Great piece of writing if I have to say so myself. I told him at the time it was his best work so far. This is a wild day here in the Delaware Valley for sure.

Going to college seems like a given and necessary thing to do these days for kids. Having the ability to practice your trade if the most important thing you can do while you are there. I’m not sure I really got to do that too much while I went back in the stone age. I’m really impressed at what is going down up at Happy Valley.
