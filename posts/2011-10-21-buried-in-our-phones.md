I was sitting in the Whole Foods Pub the other day and I could not help but notice how we are all buried in our cell phones. Or should I say we are all buried in our Smart Phones. I guess there will come a time where we don’t have to speak at all. There was a time, not too long ago, I thought this was just fine since I don’t like to hear myself talk for the sake of talking.

I wish I knew what was going on in all these personal experiences we are having with our phones. Just fascinating.
