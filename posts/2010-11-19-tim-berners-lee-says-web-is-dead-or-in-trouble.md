Interesting post on [GigaOm about how Tim Berners-Lee](http://gigaom.com/2010/11/19/like-democracy-the-web-needs-to-be-defended-its-creator-says/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+OmMalik+(GigaOM:+Tech)) (for you kids out there he created your Web…yeh that one)  is being threatened by walled gardens created by companies like Facebook and Apple.
