I’m working with a great bunch of guys from [Philadelphia Custom Block and Board](http://www.blockandboard.com/). They make really nice Butcher Block products. What ever you can think of…and I have.

I wanted them to come up with an [iPad Cheeseboard and Cutting Board](http://bit.ly/avxvBT). Why? I guess because we could. I’m feeling silly these days. It turned out to be no easy task, but I think its cool. Cut some limes on it for your Gin and tonic.  So look on the lighter side of life and enjoy your iPad with some Cheese.
