Going minimal.

  * Deleted 5k Twitter followers. Now 200. Much more enjoyable experience.
  * Deleted my entire inbox. And I keep deleting it as the hoards of SPAM come in. Feels good. One filter called “Prospects”. Still waiting on a prospect. Many frauds.
  * Eating cheaper and less healthy. I don’t feel much different. I guess I haven’t weighed myself recently, but clothes feel OK. Poor people seem fatter I noticed. More study to be done.
  * Living in one room now. Kind of my [Walden Pond](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walden_Pond) if you will.
  * That’s plenty. After all I did say minimal. Didn’t I?
