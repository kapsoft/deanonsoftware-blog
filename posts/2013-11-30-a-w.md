[I gave birth to a fantastic writer. Who would of thought?](http://www.ocregister.com/articles/martinez-539069-diaz-coach.html)

 

> Coach and player have shared many conversations during those commutes. Some days, they discuss life after high school. Other days, it’s American history or the conflict in Syria.
> 
> But on this particular evening, Diaz prodded Martinez on an important personal topic.
> 
> “Have you checked lately?” the coach asked.
> 
> Martinez, in typical teenager fashion, offered an insufficient retort: “I checked last week.”
> 
> “Well, check it!” Diaz said.
> 
> As they cruised north on the 605, Martinez took out his cell phone. The car approached the Peck Road exit when Martinez entered his user name, password and clicked.
> 
> There it was.
> 
> Martinez let out a yell.
> 
> “Oh my God!”
