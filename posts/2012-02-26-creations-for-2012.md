Here are some of what is cooking at [Kapsoft](http://kapsoft.com/). Much will be a tease since it needs to be kept top secret until released:

  1. We are working with one client on an [Expression Engine](http://expressionengine.com/) project. Using EE to hold catalog, spec, and pic data for a site makeover where the client can control his data. Should be a good pilot and I’m sold on converting [MobileStencil.com](http://www.mobilestencil.com/) over to it also.
  2. We were accepted to do a [Kickstarter.com](http://www.kickstarter.com/) project and I’m working on a prototype. Targeting 2-3 months.
  3. For the past year I’ve been working on a Web/database project. It’s a big idea that is a technical challenge. Seems simple from the outside. NOT.
  4. Finally the Android Stencil is almost complete. It will be sold on [MobileStencil.com](http://www.mobilestencil.com/).
