The following press release was posted this afternoon. In short I have sold the rights to publish the iPhone Application Sketch Book to Apress. I’m excited about the opportunity to get a wider distribution for the notebook. Especially with a first class organization like Apress.

I’d like to thank Demitri Pagonis of the graphic design firm [Malish & Pagonis](http://www.malishandpagonis.com/). Without his talents the graphics on this project would not have stood out like they did. If you need outstanding graphical and Web design he is your man. Also to Jeff Stonefield and Jeff Pepper from Apress for making the acquisition possible. I’m honored that they are publishing the Sketch Book and I look forward to many great things in the future. And to John Davis, my long time friend and co-worker. He stands by me through thick and thin. I can’t say enough what that means to me.
