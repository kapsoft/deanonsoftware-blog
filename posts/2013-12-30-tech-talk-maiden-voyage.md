As promised but a little delayed – Tech Talk. Interesting Tech items that are discussed by me and my colleagues at my client [Rushordertees.com](http://www.rushordertees.com/).

[Breaking the Page Speed Barrier with Bootstrap](http://www.appneta.com/blog/bootstrap-pagespeed/)

> “After Ilya’s talk ended, I started to think more about _why_ performance always seems to be an afterthought with developers. As I pondered this thought, I kept coming back to the following question: How hard is it to get a perfect PageSpeed Insights score?
> 
> It can’t be that hard, right? Well…there is only one way to find out!”

[Manna by Marshall Brain](http://marshallbrain.com/manna1.htm)

*Discussion/social commentary brought this one up. The world as some people would like it. Or how it is. See Will work for Free video link below. This was a follow on.

[UX Archive on how different Apps do things](http://www.uxarchive.com/)

*Very cool site that shows how different Apps handle different tasks. Some are awful and provide valuable lessons.

[Hip Hop](http://highscalability.com/blog/2013/12/9/site-moves-from-php-to-facebooks-hiphop-now-pages-load-in-6.html)

*Facebook PHP code compiled and made fast. Our service isn’t the bottleneck, but we were wondering how hard this would be to implement.

[Will work for Free Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SuGRgdJA_c)

*Long documentary that is very well done. Details how automation and tech is putting us all out of jobs. I’m depressed.

*Amazon beware.  Watch the video. Fun stuff.

[Git Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html)

\*\*Git is great. I know. I know. But I hate it. This is a methodology I can get my brain around that makes sense. Must read. Two stars. \*\*

[SQL Memory tables](http://www.domcop.com/blog/how-mysql-memory-table-saved-the-day/?rid=hn)

*Something you might not have known existed.

[MEAN](http://addyosmani.com/blog/full-stack-javascript-with-mean-and-yeoman/?utm_source=javascriptweekly&utm_medium=email)

> “A trend proliferating amongst prototypers in the Angular community is full-stack JavaScript development via the [MEAN](http://blog.mongodb.org/post/49262866911/the-mean-stack-mongodb-expressjs-angularjs-and) stack.”

*Angular rocks.

See you next time.
