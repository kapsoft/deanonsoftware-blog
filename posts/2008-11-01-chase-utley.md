Well. What can you say. It was so unexpected and off the wall I just laughed.

I love a guy who is a little bit of a bad boy. I’ve been accused of that once in a while. The torch goes on. Bam. Lets just call it out of the box thinking.

In the playoffs this guy went from a very good fielder to a great hall of fame fielder. That play at the plate was outrageous. Just like the comment.

So get a life. We are Champions. Chase is the man.
