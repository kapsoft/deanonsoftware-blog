I know its been a while. My critics are quick to remind me. Maybe we should just call it writers block. Blog block? Depression?

I liked this [blog by Leah Culver](http://www.leahculver.com/2007/05/30/a-computer-science-degree-doesnt-hurt-much/) on her CompSci education. When my kids tell me I’m a dumb sh*t, I always tell them to come back when they get their EE degree.Â  Ha. Take that! My son is a junior in high school and we are looking at colleges. A tough major wouldn’t hurt him, would it?
