Looking at the new 3Gs box early this week I could not help but notice a few things. Since I had the 3G and 3Gs stacked on top of my tequila box like trophies.Â  3Gs box is slightly smaller then 3G. But the dimensions on the smart phones are identical. Must be a green thing. Also, there were not enough base applications to fill up the front of the box back in 3G days.

This must be progress. And success.
