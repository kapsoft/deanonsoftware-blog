I was out late last night when I get a text from my son “We got bin laden!”. “What” I replied. Then the scope of the historic moment started to take hold.  Shortly after that Jake snapped his historic pic of Beaver Ave in Penn State University Park with his iPhone:

Maybe as unexpected as the justice served last night was the spontaneous celebrations that broke out across the country. These kids were 11 years old when 911 happened, but the effect of what they had to live through the last ten years is surprisingly evident now. Captured by Jake Kaplan (@jakemkaplan) for the world to see for eternity.
