I’m looking into Graph Databases at the moment. One in particular looks interesting [Neo4j](http://neo4j.org/) from [Neotechnology](http://neotechnology.com/). This looks to be have been in development for a while now and is all Java based. So a little bit of a learning curve for me, since its probably been 2-3 years since my last Java project. And I’ve don’t have all that much overall experience in Java. It’s open source with a commercial option, which I think in most cases of anything good that will be the option selected (for me at least). I’ll report my finding along the way in case anyone is interested.
