I’m willing to donate a limited number of free [iPhone Application Sketch Books](http://bit.ly/dOjmZ) to schools. Especially Computer Science, Design, and Electrical Engineering Departments in the USA. I’ll even consider High Schools.

I’m interested in promoting Mobile Application and Hardware Design in our schools in the United States. I feel this is a growth area and we need more interest from our young people. We don’t have enough courses like the CS 193P [Stanford iPhone Programming course](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/index.php). We need more!

So drop me a line and tell me why you think your school should receive the Sketch Books. Then I will select some compelling ones and I’ll even pay the shipping costs. I’ll monitor my email and twitter only for this:

and follow me and DM me at Twitter:   @kapsoft
