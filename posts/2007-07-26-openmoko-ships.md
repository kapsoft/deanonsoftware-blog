Your free Open Source Linux mobile phone is in the mail. I’ll try to post some pics of unboxing and do a review on the first developer version of this product. I hope the execution by FIC gets better in the future. Like now. There seems to be plenty of interest and customers. So no better way to kill a product then poor business execution. I wish I could get an idea to the point OpenMoko has and “only” have to execute. The hype is there. Now?
