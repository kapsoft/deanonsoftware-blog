[iPhone Application Sketch Book](http://www.mobilesketchbook.com/) has an updated Web site that incorporates a Flash Movie. This is still a work in progress and expect more changes and a better design.

As mentioned in previous post. We were just [reviewed by AppsAndHats.com](http://www.appsandhats.com/) (Another Byte Section at end of video so hang in there). Thanks to those gals. I enjoyed it. They are also giving away some Sketch Books. So check it out.

Oct 10 ends are contest to give away a ticket to the fantastic Voices that Matter iPhone Conference. Lots of learning to be had. Check out details on out site [MobileSketchBook.com](http://www.mobilesketchbook.com/).

Cheers.
