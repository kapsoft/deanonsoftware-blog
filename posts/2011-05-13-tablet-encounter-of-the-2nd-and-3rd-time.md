Apologies to all for my lack of writing. I suffered a freak injury to my hand and received 12 stitches. I’m out of work indefinately, but wanted to peck something out with my left hand to do “something”.

So I found myself in Staples last week for some unexpected reason.  At the front were the [BlackBerry Playbook](http://us.blackberry.com/playbook-tablet/) and the [Motorola Xoom](http://www.motorola.com/staticfiles/Consumers/xoom-android-tablet/us-en/overview.html?WT.srch=1&WT.mc_id=NA_US-EN_XOOM-POC_5-May-2011&WT.mc_ev=click) Tablets.

The Playbook crashed as soon as I touched it. The Xoom was completely dead, even though it was plugged in. So it was a great first experience for both. Yesterday I used my iPad 1 in a meeting outside the office to demo something Web based we created. It worked great.
