PHP. For the very first time. Hard to believe after all these years I’m doing some PHP.  It’s dangerous and seductive. Simple. Dynamic. Very much like C, which I have done a ton of over the decades. But not like C. I’m making all the rookie mistakes and I’m sure they will pass with time. So honestly I don’t know just yet.

Will I respect you in the end or will you lie to me? Hypertext Preprocessor. The Web stands on your shoulders.
