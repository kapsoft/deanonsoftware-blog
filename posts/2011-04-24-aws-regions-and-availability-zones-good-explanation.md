Here is a [really good explanation of AWS regions and Availability Zones](http://justinsb.posterous.com/aws-down-why-the-sky-is-falling#) by Justinsb.  Of course this was the big news of the week. The week the cloud went down. Just started doing some development involving AWS, so my interest is keen. We were in Eastern Region. I didn’t notice any problems, but not sure I was hitting our database during the outage period.
