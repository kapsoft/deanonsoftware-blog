I decided to clean out my Twitter and delete all I’m following. Then add back a few that I follow like the brilliant @jakemkaplan. That way I can get back some meaning when I look at the live stream. Now it’s just some meaningless dribble that rushes past me.  I’ll miss plenty of followers I’m sure, but should be interesting how many.
