<span style="font-family: Georgia">Welcome to DeanOnSoftware. I’m sure you think this is a take off on another popular site on software. Let me assure you I’m much older and have been in software much longer. For what ever that is worth. <span>Â </span>Not much. I read the other â€œonâ€ blog all the time. And like it very much. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia">My focus will be on the things we do at Kapsoft (my company â€“ <a href="http://www.kapsoft.com">http://www.kapsoft.com</a>).Â <span>Â </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia"><span></span>Our stuff tends to be on the engineering and scientific side of things. <span>Â </span>Mainly we are creating a new product in the field of Synthetic Instrumentation. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia">What is that you might ask? When we figure it out Iâ€™ll let you know. Just be assured it will revolutionize everything in the world that requires a measurement. If I donâ€™t go flat bust before we can bring it out. <span>Â </span>Or my wife divorce me first â€“ since sheâ€™s wondering why I still do stupid things â€“ like try to develop products or itsâ€™ just my hair-brain ideas. </span>

<span style="font-family: Georgia">So Iâ€™ll talk about the process Iâ€™m going through to develop it â€“ find funding â€“ battle with partners â€“ etc.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia">Iâ€™ll also talk about the state of software design, <span>Â </span>Agile development, SCRUM.Â  Iâ€™m a recently graduated scrummaster from Ken Schwaber himself <a href="http://www.controlchaos.com/">http://www.controlchaos.com/</a>, Test and Measurement, C++, and some other not so software topics. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia">Hope you enjoy or at least get your mind stimulated.</span>
