We must be entering another boom phase for tech companies. [VC’s want the young ones](http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2007/06/the_age_questio.html)? So in ten years I’ll be 2x the age limit. Not a fat chance that someone would fund one of my hair brain ideas. Oh, but wait just one minute! My wife says I need to growup and I have less maturity than my 17 year old son.  Cool, I’m back!!!
