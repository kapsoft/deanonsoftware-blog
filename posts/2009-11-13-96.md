You go through the design process of a product with blinders on sometimes. But with the iPhone Stencil (see [MobileSketchBook.com](http://mobilesketchbook.com/) in case you are hearing about this for first time) I employed a great iPhone Programmer [David Hinson](http://bit.ly/lWjCl) to review the template. My thanks to him for doing that. And of course my great [designer Dimitri Pagonis](http://www.malishandpagonis.com/) for his art work.

I want to do a very quick little rear view mirror analysis on why I think this stencil trumps the existing metal stencil that preceded ours. The short list:

  * you can see through to the paper with our stencil. Huge. It’s really hard to design when you can’t see what you are doing.
  * ours is 1.5x size. Matches our new Sketch Book from Apress. And easy to get a pencil into tight holes – try that will the metal 1.25x scale stencil.
  * ours bends. It’s durable. It’s a working item and not a museum piece.  Bend that metal sucker by half the amount you can bend ours. History.

That’s enough for now. Have a nice weekend.
