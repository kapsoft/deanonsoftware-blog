My son made a funny comment about why I wasn’t tweeting much anymore which kind of rings true for me. He said in as many words that I was bored with Twitter and only was interested in the latest and greatest thing that came out. How true.

When [Jake snapped that pic Sunday night and put it on Twitter](http://deanonsoftware.com/?p=671) it was the result of an initiative started a few years back when Twitter was young and Facebook was the current rage. I told him to try it and keep an eye on it. It “will” be a valuable tool in the future.

Many other kids were taking pictures on that balcony Sunday night. But it was him that used the lesson and got the word out. In that instant the match ignited. Teach your children well.

> …Teach your children well, their father’s hell did slowly go by,  
> And feed them on your dreams, the one they fix, the one you’ll know by.  
> Don’t you ever ask them why, if they told you, you would cry,  
> So just look at them and sigh and know they love you….
