Investigating new Web development tools. Did quick attempt using Django with Neo4j. Total PIA. I like Django but the Java connection uses some sort of JNI layer and requires Jython or pype. Pype had issues with MS libs and seems to be dependent on what VS it was built with. Total #fail.

REST, HTML, JQuery, JSON, and Neo4j what I’m thinking. I’ll have a quick look at Rails. Or could always go to MS stack.
