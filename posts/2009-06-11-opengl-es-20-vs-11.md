I know its been a while since I’ve written anything. Let’s call it a dry spell. I know all my readers are starved for my brilliant thoughts.

Time to start some comments on WWDC Monday morning (yawn?) announcements. I’m stricken by some of the things almost totally over looked with the 3G vs 3Gs debate.

First OS 3.0 announced back in March is probably the real star. So that comes hand in hand with the new hardware.

Gaming relies on OpenGL ES. With the new hardware the version gets bumped to 2.0 for OpenGL. More importantly the new versions are not compatible. So what happens to your app? Your new amazing game?

_“Sorry, please go by a 3Gs!”._
