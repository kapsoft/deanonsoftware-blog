I watched this [Big Web show 5by5.tv](http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow/45) last night. They had Tim Murtaugh on talking about his various very interesting Web projects. I downloaded his [HTML5 Reset project](http://html5reset.org/) and had a look. Great stuff. It’s a good modern starting point if you are doing new Web development. I will definitely think about using this soon. Real soon.
