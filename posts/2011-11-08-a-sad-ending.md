I love JoePa and Penn State football. Ever since my brother went there in the 60’s, I really think it’s a magical thing. Now it seems it is over. Over in a way no one could have imagined. “The horror. The horror. ”

My son (@jakemkaplan) is a senior and writes [PSU football for The Philadelphia Inquirer](http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/inq-pennstate/). Needless to say he’s a little busy right now.  He was hoping it would be a quiet week off the bye leading into a big game. Now this and most likely he will cover the end of an era. The kid seems to always end up at the right place at the right time. The story has to be told, even though it’s not the fairy tail ending he and I were hoping to witness.

We all make bad decisions in our life.  We are just human. We are not perfect. You do the best you can do and many times we come up short. Sorry JoePa.
