Seems like all the big talk today about if there is a Bubble in Tech investing at the Seed Angel level. [Front page NY Times](http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/12/03/a-silicon-bubble-shows-signs-of-reinflating/). [Then Fred VC chiming in as always](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/12/invest-in-the-mess.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+AVc+(A+VC)) about some kind of Mess?

It’s getting tiring to hear all the recent warning. What ever. If you have a great idea keep working on it and pay this crap no mind. [If you were Dead would it matter](http://deanonsoftware.com/?p=529) if they think the bubble is going to burst? Right. I didn’t think so. If its great then the next round will come. If it is not…then you come up with the next great idea.
