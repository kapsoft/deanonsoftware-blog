[](http://l.yimg.com/a/p/us/news/editorial/f/b5/fb5c69dafdce5cfada83e07a2783d3b3.jpeg)As if WWDC was not a good enough week for Apple. This surprise presentation by Steve Jobs at the Cupertino City Council really was off the charts. Is this planned building a monument like the great Pyramids of Egypt? Or is it’s amazing space ship like appearance more like the Death Star? Poised to take out the weak competition with one last burst of energy once and for all. Whatever the case it is strong work once again.

Almost as funny were the Council members idiotic questions. One asked for free WIFI. Will the building be safe? Only if they can hold off the Jedi attacks. I loved his replies. One council member said this might just be the most impressive headquarters in the USA. Steve said he will make it the best in the world. Have any doubts on that one?
