[Epigrams on Programming](http://web.archive.org/web/19990117034445/http://www-pu.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/users/klaeren/epigrams.html) by Alan J. [Perlis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Perlis). What is your favorite?

I like:

  1. “It is easier to write an incorrect program than understand a correct one.”
  2. “Interfaces keep things tidy, but don’t accelerate growth: Functions do.”
  3. “A year spent in artificial intelligence is enough to make one believe in God.”
