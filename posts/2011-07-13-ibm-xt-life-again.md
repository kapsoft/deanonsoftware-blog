I’m cleaning out my place and selling stuff on eBay. So it sold my old original IBM XT (I think I bought in 1982) to Steve Nicolas on eBay. I warned him I had not started it in a really long time. We are talking decades.

This was my first computer of any mention. This thing weighs a ton. A real tank.

Very shortly after I shipped it out Steve emailed the sytem was up and running after some quick work along with this pic .

That warms my heart.
