I have many many Blogs I read everyday. It is an eclectic geeky software business oriented one.

The winner is â€¦drum roll. [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/). This guy comes out with 2-3 excellent Blogs each day. Mostly marketing advice. But enough out of the box thinking that makes him truly unique. And writing that is excellent.

I look forward to it every day. Add him.
