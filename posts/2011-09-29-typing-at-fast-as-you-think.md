In yesterday’s [Talk Show with Gruber](http://5by5.tv/talkshow/61) he brought up an interesting point that I never really thought about until now.  He said that he types as fast as he thinks and that is why he thinks he is a lousy typist.  I think I can relate to that as I always thought I should type better. I guess it gets done.
