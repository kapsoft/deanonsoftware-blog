I know it has been a while. “Dean” probably feels neglected. Much turmoil on the home front. But I promise he will be more forthcoming in the future. The OpenMoko investigation is on the shelf for the moment. I’m investigating using some other codecs to interface our SI (Synthetic Instrument’s) – that will consist of some off the shelf USB gadgets that should be interesting. I’m taking SI out of the Test and Measurement world and showing how it is applicable to new markets. The T+M boys are great, but the market is stagnated. And they don’t seems willing to give up their old expensive test gear. Sigh.

So stay tuned dean fans. I know the one of you out there is still listening. Can you hear me?
