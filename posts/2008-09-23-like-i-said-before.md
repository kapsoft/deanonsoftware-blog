Like I said before [this is the problem](http://gizmodo.com/5053232/apple-rejects-mailwrangler-app-for-leading-to-user-confusion) with developing applications for the iPhone. Some great fellow associate of mine probably poured his guts out trying to develop that app. And in their own anti-competitive way Apple rejects their app from the App Store. So sad.

Donâ€™t get me wrong. I love this device. It is an awesome device ðŸ˜‰ Just be fair. Pleaseâ€¦
