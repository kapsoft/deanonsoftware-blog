In this [Blog the Skype CIO explains the 24 hour outage](http://blogs.skype.com/en/2010/12/cio_update.html?cm_mmc=PXBL|0700_B6-_-downtime-20101229). That must have been a fun 24 hours for him. I find interesting that Skype is a P2P network and relies on Supernodes in the Network. So when Windows clients (shocker right?) crashed and took down the Supernodes it all came tumbling down like a house of cards.

I wonder how a client becomes a Supernode? Iâ€™m guessing they have logic built into the software to detect if one is operating out of a high bandwidth location. I love the postmortems. I always find something interesting to learn.
