So I endured through a move recently and didn’t have Internet at my new place.  To solve the temporary problem I enabled the ATT Hot Spot(ing) on my iPhone4.  This really works great I must say. It’s not a fast as my old Comcast connection, but it plain just works. Another issue I had was my Windows 7 desktop monster does not have WIFI, so I plug the USB cable into the phone and that solves that issue. I can use it as a wireless router at the same time for my iPad and MacBook.

When I do a demo on the road and the client network can’t get to my “stuff”, I’ll just whip out the Hot Spot.

Highly recommended.
