I met someone interesting last Friday night. She told me about a relatively new philosophy she adopted that has her saying YES to everything. Of course being the skeptical one I asked her to jump off a bridge. She said she would discuss that first and maybe get me to retract my request.

So I started thinking about my own life. Do I say No too often? Yes maybe. And what would it hurt to say YES all the time. Some things I couldn’t fulfill and would I disappoint? Perhaps. Some of these are the internal requests I make to myself and always find a way to say No.  “No” could be the biggest cop out going. So here’s to YES. A big YES.

 

YES. YES. YES.

 

Think I got it.
