Well desk was delivered last night by Rick Sr. And Matt. Wow is all I have to say. It was love at first sight. I’m actually writing this with the table raised. Pretty cool and feels really good to stand. I’m sure I’ll mix it up between sitting and standing. Frame looks very solid and well built.

Table finish is just incredible. 7 coats of poly and the sucker really shines.

We had some issues with keyboard tray. It interfered with the cable tray, so that had to be removed. The custom key board tray will need to be shortened (less deep), so it fits all the way under the table. The usual course of events in a technical project.
