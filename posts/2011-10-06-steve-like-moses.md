Last night was elation to utter sadness in only the course of five minutes. First we found out our Kickstarter project (more on this later when we get it up for listing) got approved. Then five minutes later a text from a friend that brought the night down hard. Steve had died.

When I see the year of his birth, 1955, that haunts me. That’s the same year I was born. So young. So talented. So driven. Everyone in the world owes him a debt of gratitude I feel.

Stencils and Sketchbooks, all things they say I created. No. He did of course.

In a way Steve reminds me of Moses, one of my favorite biblical characters. Tough and courageous. He wanderd the desert of Silicon Valley for a few years. Learned. Picked up a few companies like Next and Pixar. Then he came back and brought “his” people to the promised land. But he never got to cross the river Jordan in the end. What ever that might have been for him. I’m sure it would have been great.

So I’ve been reminded to live everyday like it could be my last and finally come to grips with the tragedies of life. They don’t matter that much.

> I’ve looked at life from both sides now,  
> From up and down and still somehow,  
> It’s life’s illusions I recall.  
> I really don’t know life, at all.
