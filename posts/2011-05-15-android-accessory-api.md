Seems like Android finally heeded [my call](http://deanonsoftware.com/?p=389) on third party Accessory support with this new announcement at [Google IO on a new Android Open Accessory ADK (Devel Kit)](https://catch.com/m/Bhb1D/T-71E700q4). Host USB support. No nasty licensing chips (hello Apple). Nice SWAG given out at conference that included cable and 2 servos. Promising.
