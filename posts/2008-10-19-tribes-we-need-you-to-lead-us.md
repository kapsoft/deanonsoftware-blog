So I downloaded the latest Seth Godin book – <span id="btAsinTitle"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tribes-We-Need-You-Lead/dp/1591842336/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1224440580&sr=8-1">Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us </a></span>– and listened to it in eBook (make that audible.com)  form this weekend.

First, I really never knew what Seth’s voice sounded like before. I think I might do more of these eBooks from my iPhone. I really enjoyed it. It lets one multi-task. Work out or do what ever. And I will now have to hear Seth speak in person. I must.

On to the book. Don’t buy the book. Don’t bother. That is unless your are ready to have your foundation shaken. This is so well done. It just kills….so don’t do it. Unless as Seth writes “you are ready and committed to lead”.  The world is trying to stop you from leading. They don’t like change and feel comfortable with keeping things the same. So don’t 😉
