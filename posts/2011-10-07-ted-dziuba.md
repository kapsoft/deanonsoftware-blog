Go read [Ted Dzuiba’s Blog](http://teddziuba.com/archives.html). I was just reading a bunch of his old posts last night. Great stuff and a must for us programmer designer types.

He’s a bit of a curmudgeon and uses the F work once in a while, but it is a hard core wake up call. He urges simplicity and not to get sucked into the dark side. He’s trashes node.js and NOSQL. Thinks SCRUM is a scam and says just use what UNIX gave you from the start. I admit I’m drawn to new tech, but he’s done it successfully. “It” being the Web start-up MILO. So read it and keep to that single truth.
