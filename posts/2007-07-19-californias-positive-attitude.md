Just back from a trip to the bay area. I was out there on some business. It’s been awhile since I was out there. One thing I noted is the positive attitude most people have out there. It’s probably no wonder so much of our GNP comes out of that area. People are genuinely nice to you. I like it. I hope I’m not getting tired of the area I currently reside. I like it too. But what goes along with a positive attitude? Much more business opportunity!
