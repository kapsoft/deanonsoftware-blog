My friend Chris Nadovich pointed out to me today this latest [FCC move](http://news.com.com/Feds+snub+open+source+for+smart+radios/2100-1041_3-6195102.html?tag=nefd.lede)â€¦.

He predicted this about a year ago. It is interesting that Cisco petitioned the FCC to do this. Hmm. Wonder why them? In any event I wonder what effect this has on devices like the [FIC OpenMoko](http://www.openmoko.org/). Which is [going on sale to developers this monday on this site](http://www.openmoko.com/). I hate to see stuff like this. Makes me shift quicker to the OSS movement. These companies are taking away innovation and markets in the name of security. Do they have our best interests in mind?
