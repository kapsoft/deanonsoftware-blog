I guess I’m pretty much a geek. I never miss [dl.tv](http://dl.tv/) and enjoy some of the silly little devices that they show. One recent one was a usb stick that all its’ apparent function was to jiggle the mouse on the screen after inserted. Seemed very silly. But sometimes things go deeper. They revealed last night that the [device](http://www.wiebetech.com/products/MouseJiggler.php) Â (from wiebetech) is really used for forensics and investigations. The computer never goes to sleep with the mouse moving. Nothing is always as silly as it seems these days. Fascinating…
