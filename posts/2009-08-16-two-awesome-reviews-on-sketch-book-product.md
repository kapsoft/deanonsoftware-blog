It’s really nice to get such positive feedback on the [iPhone Application Sketch Book](http://www.mobilesketchbook.com/).

David Hinson posted a great video review on Amazon. <http://bit.ly/12PG9I>

It fills a real need for developers. I think the key is it makes the developer more organized and productive. Anyone can draw a wire-frame of the iPhone. And its pretty much a slam dunk that you are going to use pencil and paper for those UI designs.</span>
