Wow. I must have writers block. Black Monday was a real downer. But time moves on. And so do I.

So Seth Godin is offering a “[Instead of getting an MBA, consider spending six months in my office](http://www.squidoo.com/Alternative-MBA)“.

This sounds so cool. So I’ll post my application in Part 2. For all to see.

And I’ll make another promise. If he picks me I’ll go. I know. Too old. Too much baggage. Too much alimony to pay. Too much blah blah blah.

Seriously. I’m all about education. And I look forward to doing all things like this. I’ll still make that journey if called. And I encourage all my readers to apply. Join me.
