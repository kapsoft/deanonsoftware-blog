So itâ€™s been about 10 days since the [iPhone Application Sketch Book](http://www.mobilesketchbook.com/) hit the Amazon store. Iâ€™m having a blast hearing all the kind words and feedback. I know you canâ€™t please all of the people all of the time. But Iâ€™m into trying.

The one issue I wrestled with during the design phase with my graphic designer Demitri Pagonis from [Malish and Pagonis](http://malishandpagonis.com/) Â (these guys are great so thatâ€™s a plug for them!!) was the size of the template. Should it be 1x scale or should it be larger (1.5x?). Some of the feedback and blogs coming in say larger. Jeff LaMarche [just posted this review and he says larger](http://iphonedevelopment.blogspot.com/2009/08/iphone-sketch-book-mini-review.html).

Iâ€™d like a little survey on that from my users and potential users. What? You havenâ€™t bought a Sketch Book? [What are you waiting for?](http://www.mobilesketchbook.com/)

My current crop of girlfriends are saying the size is fine ðŸ˜‰ Â You think what?
