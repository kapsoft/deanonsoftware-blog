[Check out this KickStarter.com site](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danprovost/glif-iphone-4-tripod-mount-and-stand?ref=discover_pop) – what caught my attention was this iPhone4 tripod mount. The site is cool because its a viral way to fund an idea. Look at that funding number. As of today they had a commitment of $75,336. 10k trips the funding on this product. Congrats on that one. They did a nice job on the video also.

I think it looks like a nice product with a price point everyone obviously is comfortable spending. Kickstarter.com. Great idea.
