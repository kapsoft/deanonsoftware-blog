Fix you Mom’s Computer for mothers day? I have to laugh at Joel On Software’s piece on fixing your Mom’s computer for Mothers Day. <http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/05/08.html>. My Mom is long gone, God rest her soul. She never owned a computer. But my Mother-in-law – she owns a computer. I recently reformatted and reloaded her computer. Spyware, adware, viruses, and whatever you can imagine. It had it.

So I can go to bed tonight knowing I did a good thing. Well in advance. Yikes!
