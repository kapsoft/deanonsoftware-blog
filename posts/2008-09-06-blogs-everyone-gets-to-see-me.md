So life moves on. Long term relationships fail. Heartbreak. All sorts of possiblities for the future.

Everyone can see what you write. You can’t hide here. And deduce anything they like. Imaginations run wild. Riches might be being made in technology. One does never know. Do they?

Even slimy stupid obnoxious divorce lawyers can look at your blog. Can you hear me now? Can you really hear me now? There could be an iPhone winner up my sleeve. Does one know? What do you really know or add to this society? Are you making life better for the masses? Or are you just a scavenger, picking up the remains of broken dreams. Shame on you.

I love that everyone gets to see ME. Keep reading. You could be the only one….
