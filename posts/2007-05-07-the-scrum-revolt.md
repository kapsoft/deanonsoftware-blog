  <font face="Georgia">Iâ€™ve been working with SCRUM for over a year now. I think I just happened upon it through my Web travels. It has been a constant search for the holy grail of software project management. Since nothing has worked in the past, one always keeps hoping.</font>

  <font face="Georgia">We always seem to get the project done. But I hear of and have seen massive project failures. So SCRUM seemed like a good way to stay close to the business needs and keep the ROI high. But what Iâ€™m about to describe was a rocky start with SRUM. The SCRUM revolt.</font>

  <font face="Georgia">We started our Synthetic Instrument project with a set of highly skilled individuals (some contracted). These guys were and are fantastic programmers. The design of something so new â€“ like this instrument â€“ was a roller coaster ride. Back and forth we swung. At the same time I was demanding to install the SCRUM methodology in order to gain â€œcontrolâ€ and deliver small parts of the system.</font>

  <font face="Georgia">Some of the contractors were not of the team mind-set. My demands to deliver small pieces and go to the SCRUM methods (backlog, sprints, dailyâ€™s, etc.) were not being accepted. I, for the first time in a long time, became totally frustrated with these dealings. I lost my cool. And after much contemplation the contractors were terminated.</font>

  <font face="Georgia">Moving forward a few months â€“ we got back on track. We successfully completed part of the project using SCRUM. I was glad we stuck to it. But what is the message or moral of the story?</font>

  <font face="Georgia">Some folks are just not cut out to work in a team. Not to mention a SCRUM team. If individuals are not flexible and are used to working in isolation, then you might run into issues. SCRUM might not be good for them. Itâ€™s all about giving in a disciplined fashion. Not take, take, and take. My revolt was put down by massacre. It was my dime and I had that power. It was a difficult decision, but one I do not regret. So make sure everyone is on board with the concept at the start and SCRUM will deliver for you. Cheers.</font>
