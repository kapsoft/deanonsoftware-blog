I got nothing to write about on the tech front today. No new Apple products yet. No news. Flat out nothing.  Zero.  Sports is always a solid second choice.

A tweet from @jakemkaplan:

> “Between getting season credentials approved and NCAA Football 2012 being released, today is getting me really excited for football season.”

@jakemkaplan is covering the 2011 PSU football team for _The Collegian_. He will be up in the Press Box. Pretty cool for all of us.

I started thinking about the connections my family has to this game. I went to Temple. My sister went to Temple undergrad and graduate school at PSU. My Brother-in-law went to PSU.  Jake’s Mom went to PSU.

So one last thing… go Temple!  😉
