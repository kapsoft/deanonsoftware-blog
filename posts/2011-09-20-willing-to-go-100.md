Time to chime in on the [Matthew Baxter-Reynolds Blog](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2011/sep/16/ios-android-windows8-programming-choose). Everyone and Gruber did. So here’s my bullet list:

  * Yes, we all mostly write boring Software. But please don’t stop dreaming or trying.
  * Objective C is a tough slog for us C# and Java programmers. I fall into that camp.
  * Go get a Mac. You won’t be sorry. I have PC’s too.
  * Microsoft to do something relevant? I’m not feeling it. Sorry.
  * Whose got 14 months? Bullshit 14 months. [“This thing will be over in TWO minutes. Get on it!”](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Top_Gun)
  * Christmas is my birthday. Thanks for mentioning it.
  * Bubble? That Windows bubble lasted 20 years for me. Now I’m bored stiff and annoyed with them. If I can get this one to last the same amount, I’ll likely take it to the Grave. Amen.
