I will be giving a talk on [Synthetic Instruments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_instrument) at [Autotestcon 2007](http://www.autotestcon.com/2007.asp) with [Chris Nadovich](http://nadovich.com/chris/) (now a Professor at [Lafayette](http://www.lafayette.edu/) College) on the morning session of September 19th.

Hope to see you there…
