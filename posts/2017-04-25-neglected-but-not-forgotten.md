Well it has been a while since I last made a post. A long rest. I’ve been busy creating. I still sell my App Stencils at <http://Mobilestencil.com>. And I still have my consulting business: <http://Kapsoft.com>.

But more recently I released a sports related site called _[The Internet Sports Database](http://isdb.io). _Like that movie database, but for sports. So I felt the need to talk about the stack I used. I think some of you might find it interesting.

There’s been an evolution in thinking over the last 5 years. I was an expert in .NET and still do consulting in that area. But for my product development I’ve switched over to mostly (all) open source tools. PHP, Laravel, etc.

So look for some posts about that….good to be back.
