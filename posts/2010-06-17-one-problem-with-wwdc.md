So it was my first WWDC. First I’ll go on record as saying I enjoyed it. It was crowed and busy. Which is good since Silicon Valley as my friend Ken Maskrey told me on a visit down there (after the show) is a ghost town. So at least something is hot and this seems to be “it”.

At times I felt like a piece of cattle getting herded around. But that’s not my issue. My biggest issue is with the talks. I don’t think it violates my NDA to say I think they are a bit shallow and not deep enough into the subject matter. They are more of an overview then a class. I’m thinking it is more intended to sprinkle out the new stuff then to teach the subject matter. Something like [360idev](http://www.360idev.com/) probably goes much deeper into the subject matter.

It hit home when I attended the talk on EAAccessory Framework. I am involved in the subject matter. But nothing new was learned by self. So that was a bit disappointing. Let me close in saying I’d go back in a heartbeat. It was a great experience.
