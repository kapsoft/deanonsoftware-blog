Cracked it? One thing I’m wondering about the Apple TV speculation that I don’t know why hasn’t been mentioned. Make that two things.

  1. Why can’t the TV run iOS and therefore Apps? Think along the lines of a kind of augmented reality TV.
  2. Or how about being able to use touch on your TV? Like the MS Surface computer.

Just trying to think out of the box.
