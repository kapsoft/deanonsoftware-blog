I will work on an FAQ for Stencil in the near future. The iPhone Stencil was designed to be used with a mechanical pencil – since some of the cuts and turns are very tight. Remember all the widgets are kept true to 1.5x scale. I use a Zebra #2.

Pens and sharpies don’t fit in some of the small holes. Thanks to Tedd Fox for bringing this to my attention.
