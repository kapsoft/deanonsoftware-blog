Just a quick comparison between the 2 iPad Stencils using some video. Theirs seems to freak out the poor iPad. Metal not good for everything. And I contend it doesn’t make for a good stencil in practice.

Notice you can see through ours. A big deal when placed on paper. Notice ours is exact same size as the real iPad. For those who like realism.
