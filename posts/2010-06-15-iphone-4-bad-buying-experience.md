Well so far in trying all morning (off and on) it has NOT been possible to upgrade via the Apple site to the new iPhone 4. It got me thinking what an art scaling a Website still is. I call this the “Blivit” principe. Trying to put ten pounds of crap in a 5 pound bag always results in a mess.

What system does Apple use on the back end I wondered? [WebObjects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebObjects)? Maybe Stevie should call Billy and get some Windows Servers. Right. That’s happening anytime soon. Of course they could always blame it on ATT. They are in the verification chain. Must be their fault….
