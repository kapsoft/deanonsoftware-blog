I’ve been working this current consulting gig at [Rushorderteees.com](http://rushordertees.com "Rushorderstees") for a few years now. Early on I thought of ways to build a software culture with a small group of talent young (myself excluded) developers and came up with “Tech Talk”. We each take turns presenting one to many interesting “things”. Some that push the envelope and some that might help the company. Sometimes its just cool stuff like giant RC jet planes.

So I’m proud to announce I’ll be showing some of our tech talks here on the blog. With some comments. Stay tuned.
