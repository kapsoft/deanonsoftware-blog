# Welcome to Dean on Software

I'm excited to launch this new blog where I'll be sharing my thoughts and experiences on software development, technology, and the journey of building great software products.

## What You Can Expect

This blog will cover a variety of topics including:

- **Software Architecture**: Best practices and patterns for building scalable systems
- **Web Development**: Modern frameworks, tools, and techniques
- **DevOps**: Deployment strategies, CI/CD, and infrastructure as code
- **Product Development**: From idea to implementation
- **Technology Reviews**: Honest opinions on tools and services

## A Bit About Me

I'm a software developer with years of experience building web applications, APIs, and distributed systems. I've worked with technologies ranging from Laravel and PHP to modern JavaScript frameworks and cloud platforms like AWS.

## Let's Build Something Great

I believe that great software comes from understanding not just the "how" but the "why" behind our technical decisions. Through this blog, I hope to share insights that help other developers build better software and make more informed technical choices.

Thanks for joining me on this journey. Let's build something great together!
