Technical projects are hard. Looks like the [world will have to wait to come to an end](http://gizmodo.com/5051948/lhc-shut-down-because-of-electrical-fault). Dam. I had such hope. I work on stuff like this every day and some days you just canâ€™t believe how difficult it can be. Day after day. Relentless. But you keep after it and eventually you get it done. Even if the end of the world is the result.

Cheers.
