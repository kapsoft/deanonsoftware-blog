[Interesting post from GigaOM](http://gigaom.com/2010/12/16/wanted-data-scientists-to-turn-information-into-gold/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+OmMalik+(GigaOM:+Tech)) about companies looking for Architects and Data Scientists as we “roll” out of recession. Some roll.

One of my colleagues has been stressing to me for a while now this is a big trend (or course he fancies him self an Architect). It’s hard to argue against. We are producing tremendous amounts of data. I’ve created systems over the last 10 years that are still running and generating tons of data. But up until now now one was interested in doing or using the analysis of this data.  Maybe the time has arrived. Job listings just the proof of the trend?
