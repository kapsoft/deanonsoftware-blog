Saw this on 5by5.tv the other day and watched it. [Steve Jobs 1997 WWDC keynote](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LEXae1j6EY) (post note as it’s the end of conference).  So fascinating. Apple was in the the tank. He was not even the CEO yet, but he was back because of the NEXT purchase by Apple.  Some of the things developers were upset about were hilarious. OpenDoc? The one thing that stands out was the energy and vision he had. Boy did he give it.
