Just knocked this Kindle book off real fast the other night called [Rework](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307463745/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=iphoapplsketb-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=0307463745&adid=0FPRWY4RDBRCR192ACFK) by Jason Fried and David Hansson from [37Signals](http://37signals.com/). It offers some nice sound advice for bootstrapping a company. Some I like are:

  * “Learning from mistakes is overrated”
  * “Learning from failure is overrated”
  * “Planning is Guessing”
  * “The Planning Falacy”
  * “Workaholism”
  * “Fire the workaholics”
  * “Enough with ‘Entrepreneurs'”
  * “The word entrepreneur and its baggage”
  * “Scratch your own itch”
  * “What’s your problem?”
  * “No time is no excuse”
  * “There’s always time to launch your dream”
  * “Outside Money is Plan Z”
  * “Fund yourself”

Many are self explanatory. I like the scratch your own itch for ideas. The great ones of all time were not copy cats and were home grown ideas. It’s not always easy to scale a project and get to market fast enough with the fund it yourself idea. But finding money just exhausts you and kills your spirit. Few really care as much as you do. Get the book. Highly recommended.
