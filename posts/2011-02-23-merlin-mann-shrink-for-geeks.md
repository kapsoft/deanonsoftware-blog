The best way I can describe [Merlin Mann](http://www.merlinmann.com/) is that he is like a shrink for us Geeks and Techies. I’ve been rocking out of [Dan Benjamin’s](http://danbenjamin.com/) 5by5.tv shows and my favorite is the [“Back To Work”](http://5by5.tv/b2w) show with Merlin. Please check it out. It seems at some point during each show (podcast) he will start saying such profound things that it just goes right to my core. So dump your local therapy session, crawl into bed, and listen to him. I think you will agree.
