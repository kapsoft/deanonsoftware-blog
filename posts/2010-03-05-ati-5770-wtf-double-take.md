Back to the new PC box for a second if I may. I was looking at the [Level10 yesterday](http://deanonsoftware.com/?p=100) and thinking about adding one more monitor. So I gaze over at the connectors and I only see three connectors. The graphics card ordered is an [ATI 5770](http://www.amd.com/us/products/desktop/graphics/ati-radeon-hd-5000/hd-5770/Pages/ati-radeon-hd-5770-overview.aspx). Looks like this right?

Well mine does not look like that one. Did the folks at iBuyPower shaft me? Kind of. Turns out they put in an OEM version that doesn’t have the extra DVI port. FML. Well at least I’m not going crazy.
