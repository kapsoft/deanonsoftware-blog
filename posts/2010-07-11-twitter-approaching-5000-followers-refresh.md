As I approach 5000 Twitter followers I can only wonder. Don’t get me wrong. I really appreciate everyone that has followed me. I’m really aiming to find fellow software technologists and developers and have them in on the conversation.  But I’m not sure my automated methodology has really created that environment?

So I’m contemplating an experiment. Let’s call it a scorched earth experiment. Or would it be a neutron bomb approach? I’m thinking about deleting (the over 5000) folks I’m following and after seeing how many will stay with me. I’m sure the experiment has been performed before. Will the cream of the crop be left or will I just be fool for not keeping “numbers”?

What do you think?
