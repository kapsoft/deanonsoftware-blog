I must say I am impressed with Adobe’s latest version of [Flex](http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/). I downloaded the Eclipse development environment and played around with it a bit.Â  Seems to me very much like Microsoft’s WPF. Except Flash seems to be everywhere and WPF or [Silverlight](http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/default01.aspx)Â is NOT. Vector graphics is where the future will be. It should be interesting to see how this plays out. As a long time MS guy – I’m leaving my option open for the future. OSS here we come!!!
