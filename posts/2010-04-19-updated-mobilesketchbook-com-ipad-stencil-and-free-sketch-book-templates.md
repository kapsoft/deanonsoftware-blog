[Just as promised a few days back](http://deanonsoftware.com/?p=192) we have updated our [MobileSketchBook.com website](http://www.mobilesketchbook.com/) and the FREE iPhone/iPad templates are NOW! out there. Yes thats the same iPhone template that is in the Apress Sketch book. Free and easy in the 4 colors I originally intended. As a special preview to our fans we now have the  iPad template out there also.
