More [saga for the iPhone SDK. ](http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/03/14/apple-to-iphone-app-store-applicants-just-hang-tight) 

The little guy is getting “initially” rejected from the $99 program that lets one download actual code to the phone and actually run it. How many will be deterred or just plain turned off by this move. Think of it this way. You might not make it and if you spend the time and money developing something…well. You see my point.

I’m a Windows programmer. Although our companies skills can move into other platforms. It has not yet killed my interest. But I have not received my rejection or wait letter. What will I do?
