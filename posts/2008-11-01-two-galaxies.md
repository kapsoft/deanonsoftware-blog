Well the NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope is up and back running thanks to the old 486 backup processor that was turned on.  And it was already pointing to this [spectacular image](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/hst_img_20081030.html).

Two Galaxies that passed through each other. I wouldn’t want to be in the middle of that, now would I?
