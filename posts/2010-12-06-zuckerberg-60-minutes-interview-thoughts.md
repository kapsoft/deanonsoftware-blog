Interesting interview on 60 minutes tonight. I found two things interesting.  [Zuckerberg’s interviewing skills](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjkb5l0dNlo) are getting much better. Coaching or comfort level. Practice make perfect. The other thing was the IPO question. I’m thinking to might be more in the future then some people want. Except him. Having control over your own destiny is a wonderful thing. Going public conjures up a whole host of issues that I’m think he thinks is a pain in the ass.

Interesting.
