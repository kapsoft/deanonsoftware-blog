[Interesting video from TechCrunch Disrupt](http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/29/google-excite/) (I believe) where [](http://www.khoslaventures.com/khosla/default.html)[[Vinod Khosla](http://www.khoslaventures.com/khosla/default.html)<img id="snap_com_shot_link_icon" src="http://i.ixnp.com/images/v6.46/t.gif" alt="" />](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/vinod-khosla), the founder of Khosla Ventures, tells audience that when he was a board member of Excite that the Google boys almost (and would have) sold for less than 1M. That is a know when to [hold’em and know when to hold’em moment as Tom Peters](http://deanonsoftware.com/?p=406) would like to say. 167B valuation today.

I like the way Vinod thinks. He is looking for disruptive technology, but has the right business sense on top of the risk he is willing to take. Very educational and is worth 40 minutes of your time.
