I’m not sure if the [iPhone Application Sketch Book](http://mobilesketchbook.com) will be a huge success, but as I’ve mentioned in previous post I’ve had so much fun producing and marketing the notebook. But something was sent to me this afternoon that put a permanent smile on my face. 

The ladies at [appsandhats.com](http://www.appsandhats.com/) were kind enough to review the Sketch Book and apparently taped their show about it this week. Christine sent me a little taste (dare I say tease?) of the review with the above pic. Needless to say I say I’m thrilled beyond words.

So no matter what happens. That pic made it all worth while.

Cheers. Kapsoft out.
