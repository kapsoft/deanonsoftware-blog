I like this post by Fred Wilson “A VC” where he talks about creative vs engineering or [“The Creative Phase”](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/10/the-creative-phase.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+AVc+(A+VC)). I agree the creative is now much more important. That’s the only way you will strike upon something new that will catch people’s fancy. It’s not to say that engineering is not “all that” and it certainly is important. But does anyone know how Google works besides us geeks. No. So they should teach kids how to be creative, if it can really be taught. Maybe you just have it or you don’t.

It rings true.
