I’m working with a system right now that uses [Lucene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucene). [Here is a fascinating story of the implementation](http://blog.mikemccandless.com/2011/03/lucenes-fuzzyquery-is-100-times-faster.html) of the new FuzzyQuery speedup search for Lucene 4.0.  Nice to see deep complicated research oriented stuff turn into real software. Grit and determination.
