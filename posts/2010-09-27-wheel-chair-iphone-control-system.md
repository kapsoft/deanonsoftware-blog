On the iPhone Accessory watch as always. [iPhone Controlling Wheel chair.](http://www.medgadget.com/archives/2010/09/iphone_as_wheelchair_control_hub.html) Company from New Zealand looks to be part of MFI program.   “**Dynamic Controls** out of Christchurch, New Zealand has developed a system by which wheelchair users can control their iPhone using the chair’s own joystick.”

Great stuff. Good video after the jump.
