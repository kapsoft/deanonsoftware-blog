Ok. I know Iâ€™ve investigated the development environment for the iPhone. Busted. I was and remain lukewarm to the experience.

So my Blackberry was dieing last week and it was time forÂ a new phone. So I took the plunge. Being a software developer Iâ€™ve come to appreciate milestones in the business. All I can say is WOW. This thing is one of the best designed pieces of software Iâ€™ve ever seen.

Likes:

-the navigation on this thing is brilliant

-its all about the Web

-GPS and maps

-I donâ€™t need a phone and an iPod. I now have one device. I take it to work and the Gym. A better iPod then the iPod from the UI point of view.

Dislikes:

-Iâ€™m thinking the phone is not as good as my old brick Blackberry. Some weirdness. But Iâ€™m not much of a talker anyway ðŸ˜‰

-Typing. I thought I would get better after 2 weeks. Not. Iâ€™m worse. Iâ€™m a mess. Steve, put a real keyboard on this thing.

-Apps. Ok. This has plenty of potential. But nothing Iâ€™ve seen is as good as the base software on the phone. I did get spore so my daughter could enjoy it. She was ecstatic. There will be some killer apps Iâ€™m sure. Some freedom from the NDA was announced today. So there is hope.
