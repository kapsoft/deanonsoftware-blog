You always hope that you can instill someÂ passion in your kids about something in life you love. Looking back my two are Software(technology in general) and Sports. One out of two is not bad.

So congratulations to my son Jake Kaplan who is now a [Sports Journalist for the Philadelphia Inquirer](http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/colleges/penn_state/20110805_Reports__Kevin_Newsome_leaves_Penn_State_football_program.html).
