One comment by Steve Jobs flashed back to me today. I’m really curious to see if it is true. I bet it it will be.

“It’s beautiful like an old Leica Camera”.

<img class="alignnone" title="Leica Camera" src="http://image.automotive.com/f/lookback/10065568+pheader/epcp_0805_01_z+leica_m2_camera+front_view.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="330" /> 

An amazing comment that shows what this guy is all about. It’s all about making amazing products first. It was a tremendous risk to build this product.  Sure it paid off. Those cameras when I was growing up were untouchable. This is going to be in the hands of 600,000 on June 24th.  See the similarity?
