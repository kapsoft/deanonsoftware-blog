I started out doing Unix programming many many years ago. I owned a company that did real time supervisory control systems based on QNX. QNX is still around, but frustration with tools was high.Â  Programming things like database items in isam was a mess.

So in my next career incarnation I moved over to Windows. That’s been many years now. No one can argue that the programming tools are fantastic. Many successful projects have been completed. So why would I be thinking about coming out with an Open Source based project?
