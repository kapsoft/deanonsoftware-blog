A [good exercise from Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/12/yearinreview.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+typepad/sethsmainblog+(Seth's+Blog)). Listing what you shipped this year. I’m not saying 2010 was a good year business wise for me. Actually it really sucked. So Happy, Healthy, and Prosperous New Year for everyone out there. Friends and Foes.

I shipped:

 15. I’m sure a missed a few things (like stayed out of jail), but good for now.
 16. [Update] [Prototype for High End Sit and Stand Desk Desk](http://deanonsoftware.com/?p=233) that I still have hopes of marketing and selling. [Philly Custom Block and Board](http://www.blockandboard.com/) built this and I designed it – and researched the best lift base, etc.
