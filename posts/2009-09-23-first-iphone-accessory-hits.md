Many will not think think this is a big deal. But I’ve been waiting for this day. The day the first iPhone Accessory hits the market. When I say “first”, I mean the firsts one that communicates with an App via the new pipes opened up by Apple is OS 3.0. I’m not surprised Griffin was the company to have the first “thing” on the market.

It’s not earth shattering – [an FM Transmitter](http://gizmodo.com/5365347/griffins-itrip-fm-transmitter-hardware-controlled-through-an-iphone-app) – but expect many more smarter fantastic products to follow.
